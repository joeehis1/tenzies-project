## Overview

Tenzies is a project born out of the challenge to replicate the popular dice game's mechanics without referring to its source code. With a simple premise—click on dice faces to freeze numbers and reveal matching combinations—the game serves as a testament to a my coding skills and understanding. Utilizing React and Vite as the build tool, Tenzies not only offers an engaging gameplay experience but also serves as a platform to expand my proficiency in React framework development.

## Design Process

The heart of Tenzies lies in my meticulous design and implementation. Leveraging JavaScript's functionality, I crafted the core logic within the main App component, ensuring clarity and efficiency. Through thorough testing and refinement, I optimized the game experience, from dice freezing to timer management, delivering a seamless and engaging gameplay environment. The core logic of Tenzies revolves around an array of dice values, dynamically generated using JavaScript's built-in functionality. The game's main functionality, including dice freezing and timer management, is encapsulated within the main App component. A timer component tracks game duration, while a comprehensive useEffect hook ensures seamless game state management and persistent storage of game results in localStorage. Detailed insights into the application's logic and structure can be explored in src/App.jsx, designed for clarity and ease of comprehension.

## Usage
